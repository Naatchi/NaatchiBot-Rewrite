Mission Statement:
    so basically i had this old ai i made back in highschool and i want to incorperate it into a next.js/react website. im starting from scratch because my old code is bad and i think i can do better like 4 years later lol.

How it works:
    alright so it basically uses a ball tree estemator alorithm thingy. which is just fancy speak for "I guess and if its close to this bank of responses i have i think i do good" 
    kinda but not really. all you need to know is it guesses stuff over time based on how close the input data is to its contexual data and issues the tied in response. Look, it seems complicated but its really not. this has no actual use in the world though its just a funny robot to make fun of.

    [ *-*] "what is my purpouse?"
                "you are a verbal punching bag" (o-o )
    [ ;-;] "oh."
